# Source Left Header Right README

This extension opens C/C++ source files (*.c and *.cpp files) in the first editor group and header files (*.h and *.hpp files) in the last editor group. If you are working in a single column layout, it does nothing. If you do not open any C/C++ files the extension does not activate, in other words the activation event is "onLanguage:c" and "onLanguage:cpp" derivate.
